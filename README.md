# Playground Exercise - Kids and Toys

Welcome to the Playground Exercise! In this exercise, you'll be working with classes to manage a playground where kids come to play. You have already been provided with two classes: `Kid` and `Toy`, with their respective fields.

## Kid Class

The `Kid` class represents a kid who visits the playground. Each kid has the following fields:
- `name`: The name of the kid (String).
- `age`: The age of the kid (int).
- `gender`: The gender of the Kid, represented by the Gender enum.

You don't need to make any changes to the `Kid` class as it is already provided for you.

## Toy Class

The `Toy` class represents a toy available in the playground. Each toy has the following fields:
- `name`: The name of the toy (String).
- `ageGroup`: The recommended age group for the toy (String).
- `price`: The price of the toy (double).

You don't need to make any changes to the `Toy` class as it is already provided for you.

## Playground Class

The `Playground` class has also been provided, which contains the `main` method. This is the entry point of the program, and you can use this class to test your implementations.

## Project Structure

The exercise is divided into three sections, each focused on a different data structure: Lists, Sets, and Maps. Each section has its own set of tasks for you to complete.

- [List Tasks](List-Tasks.md)
- [Set Tasks](Set-Tasks.md)
- [Map Tasks](Map-Tasks.md)

You can navigate to each section using the links above and follow the instructions provided in each file.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercise, you can clone the project repository and begin implementing the required tasks. Make sure to read the instructions carefully and test your code thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to test your implementations thoroughly and handle edge cases gracefully.
- Feel free to add any additional methods or functionalities that you think would enhance the playground management system.

Have fun working on the Playground Exercise! Good luck!
