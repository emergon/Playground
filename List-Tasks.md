# List Tasks

In this section, you will work with `List` to manage the kids that arrive at the playground.

## Basic Tasks

### Task 1: Insert Kids in a List

1. Create an `ArrayList` to store the kids who arrive at the playground.
2. Implement a method that allows you to add a new kid to the list.
3. Test the method by adding a few kids to the list.

### Task 2: Print Kids List

1. Implement a method to display all the kids currently in the list.
2. Test the method to ensure that all the kids are displayed correctly.

### Task 3: Get Kid by Index

1. Implement a method that takes an index as input and returns the kid at that index in the list.
2. Test the method to ensure that the correct kid is returned for the given index.

### Task 4: Update Kid's Information

1. Implement a method that allows you to update a kid's information (name, age, gender) based on their index in the list.
2. Test the method by updating the information of a few kids in the list.

### Task 5: Add Multiple Kids at Once

1. Implement a method that allows you to add multiple kids to the list at once using the `addAll` method.
2. Test the method by adding a group of kids to the list in one operation.

### Task 6: Check if a Kid is in the List

1. Implement a method that checks if a given kid is present in the list.
2. Test the method by checking if specific kids are present in the list.

### Task 7: Sort Kids by Age

1. Implement a method to sort the kids in the list based on their age.
2. Test the method to ensure that the kids are sorted correctly.

### Task 8: Convert Kids List to an Array

1. Implement a method to convert the list of kids to an array using the `toArray` method.
2. Test the method by converting the list to an array and printing its contents.

### Task 9: Remove a Kid from the List

1. Implement a method to remove a kid from the list based on their index.
2. Test the method by removing specific kids from the list.

## Optional Challenges

Feel free to attempt the following challenges for a more advanced playground:

### Challenge 1: Use Iterator to Process Kids

1. Implement a method that uses an iterator to process the list of kids.
2. For example, you can use an iterator to remove certain kids from the list or modify their information.

### Challenge 2: Use Stream to Process Kids

1. Implement a method that uses the Java Stream API to process the list of kids.
2. For example, you can use streams to filter kids based on certain criteria, map their names, or find the average age of the kids.

## Challenge 3: LinkedList vs. ArrayList Performance

In this challenge, you will compare the performance of LinkedList and ArrayList when performing various operations on a large dataset.

1. Create a large dataset of elements (e.g., integers or custom objects) to work with. The dataset should contain a significant number of elements (e.g., at least 100,000 elements).

2. Implement methods to perform the following operations on both LinkedList and ArrayList:
   - Insertion: Add elements at the beginning, middle, and end of the list.
   - Deletion: Remove elements from the beginning, middle, and end of the list.
   - Access: Retrieve elements from random positions in the list.

3. Measure and compare the time taken for each operation on both LinkedList and ArrayList using the `System.currentTimeMillis()` method.

**Remember, optional challenges are more demanding and may require a deeper understanding of Java features. Have fun exploring these tasks if you feel up to the challenge!**
